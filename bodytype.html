          <p>An ectomorph, an endomorph, or a mesomorph to those who have not heard these words may sound like scientific terms or the names of cartoon characters, 
             but it is not that complicated as it sounds like. In this article, we will review what these words mean and why it is important to know which type you 
             belong to, and how to build a beautiful and fit body.
             Of course, there are subtypes as well and not all of us can be assigned to one or another body type, but the science agrees that these are the three main 
             types. We will analyze the main features of these body types and where should we concentrate most when exercising. What food should be taken by each of the 
             body types?

            <p>Mesomorph is the most common male body type. For people with this body type, it is very easy to get "a job done" in the gym.</p>
            <p>Because of their muscle structure and large bones, mesomorphs can easily keep the body in good shape. With a healthy diet plan and the right 
                exercise program, mesomorphs can easily gain muscle and lose fat. In other words, the principle of "eating pizza - gaining weight - going to 
                the gym - losing weight" applies to them. Workouts do not require any special exercises, but it is important to do cardio workouts, not only 
                for weight control but also to keep the heart healthy. However, older mesomorphs should pay more attention to calorie intake, as fat cells grow 
                faster with aging.
            </p>
            <p>The main differences in the metabolism of mesomorphs are reduced cortisol production and a high P-ratio (the body's ability to absorb protein 
                from food). In fact, mesomorph muscles are able to get more nutrition, to store more glycogen, and to recover faster after a workout, so athletes
                can exercise more often.<br>
                Due to the high level of growth hormone and testosterone, mesomorphs practically do not gain fat mass. Therefore, up to a certain age, they can 
                consume high-calorie food with no worries of becoming overweight. That's why mesomorphs are often inclined to underestimate the importance of diet
                for weight loss. 
            </p>
            <p>If trying to gain more weight, mesomorphs should pay extra attention to the intake of saturated fats. In order not to gain excess weight, they are
                advised not to exceed the consumption of 10-15 g of such fats for every 1000 kcal. Otherwise, they risk raising the level of "bad" cholesterol. In 
                this case, the total proportion of fats should not exceed 30-35% of the total calory consumption.<br>
                For muscle growth, the level of carbohydrate intake is permissible along the upper limit (about 2-3 g per kg of body weight), with an emphasis on 
                complex carbohydrates and fiber. Gainer and creatine also have a positive effect on weight gain. However, as we mentioned above, in the absence of 
                regular physical training, an excess of carbohydrates will quickly lead to an accumulation of excess fat - especially on the waste.
            </p>
            <p>Uncontrolled consumption of carbohydrates with a high glycemic index disrupts the body's response to insulin and disbalance the hormonal system. At 
                the same time, a high level of testosterone of mesomorphs causes accelerated fat deposition on the abdomen, which can increase the 
                risk of heart diseases.
                For the mesomorph to lose weight it is recommended to cut off the intake of "fast" carbohydrates. Sweets, pastries, and desserts should be excluded 
                from the daily menu. Also mesomorphs should include cardio and  HIIT training to their everyday routine.
            </p>
            <p>If you belong to this body type and are wondering what is the best sport for your body, well, mesomorphs can perform at many sports, including rugby, 
                bodybuilding, hockey, running, rowing, swimming.

            <p>The shape of the endomorph is a massive bone structure and a wide waist. The metabolism is usually slow. It provokes a quick gain of fat - while at the 
                same time complicating the process of losing weight.The main advantage of endomorph is a large bone structure, which helps to grow muscle easily. Also,
                this physique type is good at power performance and the ability to withstand loads. Endomorph athletes dominate sports such as boxing, powerlifting,
                and bodybuilding.<br>
                However, the disadvantage of endomorph is the tendency to gain fat. To maintain an athletic body (and low levels of subcutaneous fat), endomorphs need 
                both regular fat-burning workouts (including cardio) and a strict diet.<br>
                Endomorphs should pay attention to daily diet. It is advisable to consume less fat (but not to eliminate it!) and carbohydrates, and consume more food 
                rich in protein and fiber.
                The more muscular the body is- the faster the metabolism is. However, most of the time, the body is not able to build muscles and burn fat at the same 
                time - that is why both: the muscular mass building and the shredding cycle will become the best training format for endomorphs.Because of the slow
                metabolism of the novice-endomorph, the muscles are not able to store energy. To “boost” the metabolism, it is recommended to take pre-workout 
                supplements and a small portion of fast carbohydrates 30-40 minutes before the start of the training - this will give the muscles more energy for
                exercise.

            </div>

            <p>Ectomorphs are usually the most likely to give up and quit going to the gym because it is very difficult for them to see their body change. It is more
                 difficult to gain weight for ectomorphs than for endomorphs to lose it. Because of the fast metabolism, calories are "burned" too quickly so the 
                 ectomorph can not gain any muscle mass. Ectomorph needs to consume more calories each day than the recommended intake for other body types. When 
                 working out, ectomorphs should focus on training large muscle groups. Basic free weight exercises are the best option for building muscle mass fast. 
                 In general, muscle building is a slow process for an ectomorph. The biggest advantage- ectomorphs muscle mass is lean.
                 Ectomorphs are good in sports such as basketball, marathon running, high jump, swimming, tennis.

              <p>
                We know that modern science is very accurate about the theory of body types. But there are no clear criteria by which a person refers to one of them. 
                There will always be exceptions.
                Some people (most often in women), the top of the body may have signs of one type, and the bottom of another. That is why extremely difficult to
                determine whether a person is an endomorph, mesomorph, or ectomorph.<br>
                The author of the theory of body types, William Sheldon, said that “pure” somatotypes occur very rarely. In real life, an ordinary person is a
                combination of all three body types. The scientists have identified more than 10 body types.
